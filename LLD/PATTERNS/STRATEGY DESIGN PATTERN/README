# 🤖 Strategy Design Pattern — Robot Simulation Example

## 🎯 What Are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are **proven solutions to recurring problems** in software design.  
Instead of reinventing the wheel, developers apply these structured approaches to build more maintainable, scalable, and flexible systems.

- **They are not frameworks.**  
- **They don't solve all problems magically.**  
- **They are just blueprints or best practices.**

👉 Think of them like architecture designs:  
Whether you're building a house or a mall, the same structural ideas like "support beams" apply in different forms.

## 💡 Why Design Patterns Exist?

- To write **cleaner** and more **understandable code**.
- To avoid **code duplication**.
- To help teams follow a **common vocabulary**.

## 🎲 What Is the Strategy Design Pattern?

The **Strategy Pattern** is a **behavioral design pattern**.  
It allows you to define a **family of algorithms** (or behaviors), put them into separate classes, and make them interchangeable.

Instead of hardcoding a behavior into a class, the behavior is encapsulated in a separate object, called a **strategy**.

## ⚙️ Real-Life Analogy

Imagine robots:

- Some robots can fly.  
- Some cannot.
- Some can talk.  
- Some cannot.

If we used inheritance, we would end up with:

- FlyingTalkingRobot  
- NonFlyingTalkingRobot  
- FlyingNonTalkingRobot  
- ... (Explosion of subclasses!)

The **Strategy Pattern** solves this by letting us plug in "fly behavior," "talk behavior," etc., as needed.

## 🛑 Why Inheritance Alone Is Bad Here?

Inheritance creates a **rigid structure**:

- **Tightly coupled:** Child classes depend too much on the parent.
- **Code duplication:** Adding a new behavior means updating many child classes.
- **Cannot change behavior at runtime:** Once the class is created, its behavior is fixed.

---

## ✅ Why "More Inheritance" Is Not the Solution?

Using more and more subclasses **multiplies complexity**.

Instead:

- Define **interfaces** for behaviors.
- Implement behaviors separately.
- Inject those behaviors into objects as needed.

---

## 🌟 How Strategy Pattern Solves This Problem?

1. **Encapsulation of behavior:**  
   - Walking, flying, talking, projecting behaviors are separated from the robot classes.
   
2. **Loose coupling:**  
   - Robots only know about behavior interfaces, not specific implementations.

3. **Flexibility:**  
   - You can swap or change behavior objects at runtime if needed.
   
4. **Clean UML Design:**  
   - Class diagrams stay organized and scalable.
